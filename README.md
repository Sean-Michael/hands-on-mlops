# Hands On MLOps

A companion repository to my notes repo: [hands-on-ml-notes](https://github.com/Sean-Michael/hands-on-ml-notes) where I automate the Machine Learning examples and exercises during my stufy of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch* by Aurélien Géron.

## Description

The book works through many examples of Machine Learning concepts and workflows. Each chapter has an associated Jupyter notebook, so I thought it would make for a great opportunity to play MLOps Engineer. I would take the notebooks from my Data/AI Scientist (the book) and implement them in a scalable 'production' pipeline. Creating Dockerfiles, automating data manipulation, model serving over `FastAPI`, workloads on `Kubernetes` ... doesn't that just sound fun?

## Organization

I'm not really sure where I want this repository to go in terms of content and organization. For now I'll just put everything I need in here as the need arises. In the future I would like to tie this together with my other Platform Engineering related projects to create a more succinct ecosystem and private sandbox platform.
